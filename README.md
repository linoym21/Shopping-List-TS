# Shopping-List-TS

Please refer to the following website: https://shopping-list-ts-frontend.onrender.com. The website was created using React-TS for the client, Node.js for the server, and MongoDB Atlas for the database.

It is an extension of the Shopping List project: https://github.com/linoym21/Shopping-List/tree/main. In contrast, the client side is written in typescript. You can find the server side at the following link: https://github.com/linoym21/Shopping-List/tree/main/backend.

This database has been initialized with products. Feel free to adapt it to meet your needs. A shopping list can be created, items may be added, removed, quantities may be increased or decreased.

I hope you have a pleasant shopping experience at the supermarket!
